# Because you're emitting a signal here, you need to connect that signal to 
# something to actually make it do a function. To do that, go to the
# `Signals` menu next to the inspector tab and double click it. 
# You would then need to connect it to the parent script or scene script
# and also name it something. You can name it ` garlic_collect` as seen 
# below, in the next script.
